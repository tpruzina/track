Database

* For simplicity sake, files are tracked by their path, this means that file
relocation is gonna be treated like file removal (file must be tracked again)



FILE
<PK file_path> <hash>

FILE_VERSION
<PK hash> <file backup path> <mtime> <md5>

When the file is removed, <md5> string equals zero (this allows for creation
of snapshots)
